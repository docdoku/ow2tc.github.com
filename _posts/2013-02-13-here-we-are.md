The [OW2](http://ow2.org/) Technology Council (**TC**) now holds this website to give details on the infrastructure and projects. Each project will have a chance to introduce itself with more technical resources, samples, code, ...

As a reminder, the **TC** is responsible

- for building the overall technical architecture, including defining technical guidelines
- for providing technology validation
- for making Project life-cycle decisions (see the project page and the lifecycle criteria)
- for monitoring production and overall Projects consistency.

The **TC** also defines OW2's architecture vision, it validates the founding charters of Projects and Initiatives and it approves reuse of non-OW2 code into Projects and Initiatives.
The Technology Council provides guidelines to the Management Office (the infrastructure runners) regarding  the evolution of the OW2 technical platform.

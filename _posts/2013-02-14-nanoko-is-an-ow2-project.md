**The OW2 TC is pleased to announce that [Nanoko](http://nanoko.org/) is now an OW2 project!**

Nanoko is an initiative to provide methodologies, tools and frameworks to build modular and adaptive web applications. 
It focuses especially on client-side development using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

Developing such client-side applications is a genuine challenge today.

First, web applications were tackled by numerous types of development process, developer and technologies: PHP, Rails / Grails, JavaEE and so on.

However, the client-side development was always considered as ugly. As JavaScript, the main language used in such applications, is not made to scale.

Recently, several frameworks have attempted to improve this state, but generally do not cover the complete development lifecycle.
They are just a library easing development, or a framework promoting a specific architecture pattern (MVC, MVVM).

Nanoko aims to provide tools to make such development robust, easy and modular. Unlike other projects:

- Nanoko does not impose an architectural pattern, you are free to use your prefered pattern.
- Nanoko covers the complete lifecycle : design, development, packaging, tests, deployment
- Nanoko offers reusable components to improve quality and development velocity

Welcome to the Nanoko team as OW2 citizen!
